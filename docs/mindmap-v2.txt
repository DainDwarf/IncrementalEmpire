New plan for the game.

Base idea: Turn-based incremental with various choices and evolving gameplay

=========================

Turn-based: Production happen when you click for next turn, no idle gaming

Incremental: You can "rebirth" which gives some rebirth ressource in exchange for starting again.

Choices: You have a rebirth template, with more choices unlockes with achievements and upgrades. And of course can choose what production to start at each turn

Evolving: Different strategies and new ways to build your empire given more upgrades.

==========================

Production: You have different base ressources, and for each base ressources you have buildings, workers and tools.

Next turn: Each worker produces its production, in a "top-down" way. Multi-turn productions, or not?

No idle gaming: No timer, except maybe for achivements

Rebirth: Uses a formula to tell how much rebirth ressource is gained given the state of the empire.

Rebirth ressource: Mana, Culture, Money, Science. Do you choose at the start of empire or at the end? I prefer start.

Start again: Rebirth template gives the state of the new empire.

Achievements: Need to do things, often with a turn limit, to unlock "template points" or template possibilities

Upgrades: Cost rebirth ressources to give various effects. 4 categories corresponding to the ressources? (cross upgrades maybe as well?) Upgrade tree, need to unlock A to get B?

Evolving: Given the upgrades, templates and rebirth choices, you have different ways of handling how to produce more?


==========================
Base ressources:
    * Population
    * Food
    * Construction material (wood and stone)
    * Metals
    * Oil
    * Energy
    * ???

Buildings: Increases worker limit
Worker: Produce "something" (base ressources, workers, buildings, tools)
Tools: Boost worker production

Top-down production: If worker A produces tool for worker B, worker A is done first and aids the production of worker B in the same turn. Need some graph topology?
