# Incremental Empire

[Incremental Empire](https://daindwarf.github.io/IncrementalEmpire) is a turn-based incremental game. Why should you have to wait for those numbers to go up?

## Features

In Incremental Empire, you will need to restart the game to improve how your empire can evolve. Restarting will give you points that can be spent for upgrades that will let you advance further in your next gameplay. You will also need to unlock achievements to restart more efficiently, and beat challenges to go further in the game.

Features include:
* (Re)start with various empire types that have different gameplay and goals
* Unlock tons of upgrades and achievements
* Non linear progress through the various empire types
* (Planned) Automation
* (Planned) Challenges that require you find a real strategy to unlock progress
* (Planned) Evolve your empire through the ages and start again, or unlock ways to start your next empire in a more advanced state
* (Planned) From stone age and before, to space age and beyond!

Does not include:
* Waiting
* Idle game
* Keeping your computer on all night to get more progress while slowly heating the planet

## Inspiration

This game was inspired by other inventive incremental games. Give them a try, they are worth it!

* [Antimatter Dimensions](https://ivark.github.io)
* [Factory Idle](https://factoryidle.com/)

# Contributing

The game is developed using [Ember.js](https://emberjs.com/) and [ember-cli](https://ember-cli.com/). The various icons are from [fontawesome](https://fontawesome.com)'s free icon library.

## Future direction

I plan the game and its features using the Kanban-style github project. You can [visit it](https://github.com/DainDwarf/IncrementalEmpire/projects/1) to get an idea of what is currently going on.

I am open to suggestions and ideas, but there are no designated place yet for those (coming later)
